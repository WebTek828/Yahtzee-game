# Yahtzee-game
Yahtzee game with react.js

I built this yahtzee game for my portfolio.Out of all the things I have worked with,I find this one a lot more challenging.But it only took me half of the day to get this work done.
This game is from Colt Steele react bootcamp but I didn't build it by following along,in fact I didn't even look at the source code once.That's why my code is too messy.
